A top notch person, quick replies and very respectful. I had many questions before booking this place and he replied right on time. \nThe place is clean and has all the required amenities. Bed/couch/floor/washroom, all clean and no bad smell. Dedicated internet access, super quick, no lag. I took my PS5 and had no trouble gaming online.\nOne thing I should add for bnb or host themselves is to start adding the total size of apartment. I found this apartment somewhat small. Especially the washroom, you are showering next to toilet seat, kinda touching it, if you don't adjust yourself. The sink is small, makes it difficult to do wudhu(for salah) without splashing yourself with water. Even if washing your face, all water falls outside sink. The mirror infront of sink can be moved sideways to get more room. The couch is OK for two people, not comfortable. I would suggest adding a new one considering there is enough space. Maximum 2 people can stay.""]"
